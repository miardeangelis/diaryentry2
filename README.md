Woke (is there such a word) at 6 oclock—slipped down the declivity of unconsciousness again until 7. arose and tried to shave with a razor so dull that every time I scraped my face it looked like I was in the throes of cholera morbus. by shaving often I too a certain extent circumvent the diabolical malignity of these razors—if I could get my mind down to details perhaps could learn to sharpen it, but on the other hand I might cut myself— As I had to catch the 7:30 am train for New York I hurried breakfast, crowded meat potatoes, eggs, coffee, tandem down into the chemical room of my body.  Ive now got dyspepsia in that diabolical thing that Carlyle calls the stomach, rushed and caught train— Bought a New York World at Elizabeth for my mental breakfast— Among the million of perfected Mortals on Manhattan island two of them took it into their heads to cut their naval chord from mother earth and be born into a new world, while two other less developed citizens stopped two of the neighbors from living— The details of these two little

must have charge of this branch of the vegitable kingdom. It has just occured to me that the brain may digest certain portions of the food, say the etherial part, as well as the stomach—perhaps dandruff is the excreta of the mind—the quantity of this material being directly proportional to the amount of reading one indulges in. A book on German metaphysics would thus easily ruin a dress suit. After breakfast start reading Hawthorne's English Note Book dont think much of it. perhaps Im a literary barbarian and am not eyet educated up to the point of appreciating fine writing— 90 per cent of his book is descriptive of old churches and graveyards and coronors He and Geo Selwyn ought to have been appointed perpetual coroners of London. Two fine things in the book were these. Hawthorne shewing to little Rose Hawthorne a big live lobster told her it was a very ugly thing and would bite everybody, whereupon she asked "if the first one God made, bit him" again "Ghostland is beyond the jurisdiction of veracity" I think freckles on the skin are due to some salt of Iron, sunlight brings them out by reducing them from high to low state of oxidation—perhaps with a powerful magnet applied for some time, and then with proper chemicals, these mud holes of beauty might be removed. Dot is

very busy cleaning the abode of our deaf and dumb parrot she has fed it tons of edibles, and never got a sound out of it. This bird has the taciturnity of a statue, and the dirt producing capacity of a drove of buffalo. This is by far the nicest day of this season, neither too hot or too cold. it blooms on the apex of perfection an Edenday Good day for an angels picnic. They could lunch on the smell of flowers and new mown hay, drink the moisture of the air, and dance to the hum of bees. Fancy the  ==Soul of Plato=={Q5493077} astride of a butterfly, riding around Menlo Park with a lunch basket. Nature is bound to smile somehow. Holzer has a little dog which just came on the veranda. The face of this dog was a dismal as a bust of Dante, but the dog wagged its tail continuously This is evidently the way a dog laughs I wonder if dogs ever go up to flowers and smell them I think not flowers were never intended for dogs, and perhaps only incidentally for man, evidently Darwin has it right They make themselves pretty to attract the insect world who are the transportation agents of their pollen, pollen freight via Bee line There is a bumblebees nest somewhere near this veranda, several times one came near me some little information (acquired experimentally) I obtained when a

small boy causes me to lose all delight in watching the navigation of this armed flower burglar. Had dinner at 3 p.m. ruins of a chicken, rice pudding I eat too quick at 4 oclock Dot came around with her horse "Colonel" and took me out riding beautiful roads saw 10 acre lot full cultivated red raspberries, "A burying ground" so to speak.—got this execrable pun off on Dot Dot says she is going to write a novel, already started on—she has the judgement of a girl of 16 although only 12 We passed through the town of Metuchen, this town was named after an Indian chief, they called him Metuchen the chief of the rolling lands, the country being undulating. Dot laughed heartily when I told her about a church being a heavenly fire escape. Returned from drive at 5 pm commenced read short sketches of life's Macauley Sidney Smith, Dickens & Charlotte Bronte. Macauley when only 4 years ago omnivorous reader, used book language in his childish conversation.  when 5 years old, lady spilled some hot coffee on his legs, after a while she asked him if he was better he replied "Madam the agony has abated" Macauleys mother must have built his mind several years before his body. Sidney Smiths flashes of wit are perfect to call them chesnuts would be literary blasphemy

They are wandering jewlets to wander forever in the printers world Dont like ==Dickens=={Q5686}—dont know why I'l stock my literary cellar with his works later. ==Charlotte Bronte=={Q127332} was like ==DeQuincy=={Q317160}, what a nice married couple they would have been I must read ==Jane Eyre=={Q182961}. played a little on the piano its badly out of tune two keys have lost their voice. Dot has just read to me outlines of her proposed novel, the basis seems to be a marriage under duress I told her that in case of a marriage to put in bucketfulls of misery. This would make it realistic. speaking of realism in painting etc ==Steele Mackaye=={Q1668569} at a dinner given to H H Porter, ==Wm Winter=={Q8020478} and myself told us of a difinition of modern realism given by some frenchman whose name I have forgotten. "Realism, a dirty long haired painter sitting on the head of a bust of Shakespeare painting a pair of old [bo-] boots covered with dung" The bell rings for supper I goe Sardines the principal attraction on seeing them was attacked by a stroke of vivid memory of some sardines I eat last winter that caused a rebellion in the labyrinth of my stomach could scarcely swallow them today

They nearly did the "return ball" act. After supper Dot pitched a ball to me several dozen times first I ever tried to catch. It was a hard as Nero's  heart nearly broke my baby finger gave it up— learned Dot and Maggie how to play Duck on the rock They both thought it great fun, and this is sunday My conscience seems to be oblivious of sunday it must be incrusted with a sort of irreligious tartar. If I was not so deaf I might go to church and get it taken off or at least loosened—peccavi I will read the new version of the bible Holzer is going to use the old laboratory for the purpose of hatching chickens artificially by an electric incubator. He is very enthusiastic gave me full details he is a very patient and careful experimenter think he will succeed everything succeeded in that old laboratory Just think electricity employed to cheat a poor hen out of the pleasures of maternity Machine born chickens What is home without a mother I suggested to H that he vaccinate his hens with chicken pox virus, then the eggs would have their embryo heriditarily innoculated  & none of the chickens would have the disease, for economys sake he could start with one hen and rooster. He being

a scientific man with no farm experience I explained the necessity of having a rooster, he saw the force of this suggestion at once. The sun has left us on time, am going to read from the encyclopedia Brittanica to steady my nerves and go to bed early. I will shut my eyes and imagine a terraced abyss, each terrace occupied by a beautiful maiden to the first I will deliver my mind and they will pass it down down to the uttermost depths of silence and oblivion. Went to bed worked my imagination for a supply of maidens, only saw Mina Daisy & Mamma Scheme busted—sleep.
